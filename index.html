        question: "Read the following stanza from Thomas Hardy's poem. Which analysis best explains its central themes and literary devices?\n\nI look into my glass,\nAnd view my wasting skin,\nAnd say, 'Would God it came to pass\nMy heart had shrunk as thin!'\nFor then, I, undistrest\nBy hearts grown cold to me,\nCould lonely wait my endless rest\nWith equanimity.\nBut Time, to make me grieve,\nPart steals, lets part abide;",
        options: [
          "This Hardy poem contrasts physical aging with emotional pain. The speaker's body ages with wasting skin but his heart stays young, still feeling hurt from rejection. He wishes his heart had shrunk too so he could face death or endless rest calmly. Time is personified as cruel, taking youth but leaving emotional suffering. Main devices are metaphor, personification, imagery, euphemism, and irony.",
          "The poem explores the theme of spiritual renewal and divine forgiveness. The 'glass' symbolizes a mirror of the soul, and 'wasting skin' reflects moral decay. The speaker prays for a heart as thin as his skin to achieve purity. Time is shown as a benevolent force that removes sin but preserves faith, using allegory and biblical allusion.",
          "This stanza presents a meditation on artistic creation and intellectual decline. The 'glass' represents the poet's fading inspiration, and 'wasting skin' signifies lost creativity. The speaker desires emotional detachment to focus on his work. Time is personified as a thief of talent, employing metaphors of theft and imagery of emptiness.",
          "The poem deals with social isolation and economic hardship in old age. The 'wasting skin' is a metaphor for poverty and neglect, while the 'heart' symbolizes unfulfilled desires for companionship. The speaker critiques a society that abandons the elderly, using irony and social commentary to highlight injustice."

        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: "Option 1 correctly identifies the central contrast between physical aging and enduring emotional pain, the speaker's wish for emotional numbness, the personification of Time as cruel, and the key literary devices used (metaphor, personification, imagery, euphemism, irony).",
